    "## Regularization in Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In our linear regression model, we introduce a **regularization** term. The primary purpose of this term is to mitigate **overfitting**. Overfitting occurs when our regression model performs exceptionally well on the training data but fails to generalize effectively to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Role of `np.eye` and Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `np.eye` in numpy is used to generate an **identity matrix**. This identity matrix, when scaled by our regularization parameter (often denoted as \\( \\lambda \\) or `r` in our context), is added to the **Gram matrix** \\( X^T X \\). The Gram matrix is the result of multiplying the transpose of matrix \\( X \\) with \\( X \\) itself, capturing the relationships between the features across all data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding the scaled identity matrix to \\( X^T X \\), we incorporate the regularization penalty into our weight calculation process. This penalty ensures that our model doesn't rely too heavily on any single feature and is less prone to overfitting.\n",

    "Is this just the entire code being placed in a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Not exactly a function, but rather a loop. The loop is iterating over different values of s and, for each value, it's shuffling the data, splitting it into training, validation, and test sets, training a linear regression model, making predictions, and then computing the RMSE. The entire process you previously went through for one dataset split is now being repeated for multiple splits, determined by different random seeds (s).\n",
    "What is s standing for?\n",
    "\n",
    "s stands for the random seed value used by the np.random.seed(s) function. Setting a seed ensures that the random operations, like shuffling in this case, are reproducible. By iterating over different seed values, you're essentially creating different shuffles (or permutations) of your dataset. This allows you to evaluate the model's performance across various data splits, giving a more robust understanding of its generalization capabilities.\n",
    "Think of s as a key to a particular arrangement of a deck of cards. Each key (s value) will shuffle the deck in a unique but reproducible way. By trying out different keys, you're seeing how your game (or model) performs with different card arrangements.\n",
    "Additional Insight:\n",
    "\n",
    "The list rmses is collecting the RMSE values for each shuffle (seed value). At the end of the loop, you'll have an array of RMSE values, one for each seed. This can be useful to compute statistics like the average RMSE or its variance across different data splits."
